* \struct Node

* \brief The node in the linked list
* 
* This structure represents the node in our linked list implementation.
* Since this linked list is implemented in an array the previous and next
* members, which would be pointers in a dynamically allocated linked list,
* are integers in this implementation.  Their values correspond to the array
* index where the previous and next nodes reside.  
* 
* The value in_use is to let us track which array entries are currently used.
* If you are re-using this code in a heap or arena assignment this value does
* NOT represent whether your heap block is free or in-use.  You will need to add
* a new member to this struct to track that.
* 
* The value element is an integer to demonstrate the functionality of a sorted list.
* If you are reusing this code you will need to change that datatype to be the
* actual data type in your implementation, e.g you're creating a linked list of strings
* then you would change the dataype of value from an int to a char*.
